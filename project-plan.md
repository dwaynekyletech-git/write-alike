### Key Learnings:
- **Clerk Middleware**: Version 6.23.2 requires simpler middleware setup than older versions
- **Build Testing**: Important to test builds frequently - caught TypeScript and CSS issues early
- **Authentication Flow**: Explicit redirect URLs needed for smooth Google sign-in experience
- **Brand Consistency**: "Write Alike" (with space) is the correct brand name throughout
- **RLS vs App-level Auth**: Disabled Supabase RLS in favor of Clerk authentication for simpler security model
- **File Processing**: Dynamic imports prevent build-time issues with pdf-parse library
- **AI Structured Output**: Using Zod schemas with generateObject provides reliable AI responses

### Current Status:
- âœ… **Authentication working** - Sign-in/sign-up with Google integration
- âœ… **Dashboard foundation ready** - Professional UI with sidebar navigation  
- âœ… **Database schema created** - Ready for user data and documents
- âœ… **File upload system** - Drag-and-drop interface supporting PDF, DOCX, TXT

### ðŸš€ READY FOR NEXT PHASE:
The foundation is rock-solid. Users can now upload their writing samples, get comprehensive AI analysis of their writing style, AND create documents with a professional rich text editor. The next phase is implementing the core feature: text selection and AI-powered writing assistance using their learned style patterns.

### ðŸ”§ PENDING FIXES:
- **Title Input Focus Issue**: When typing in "Untitled Document" title field, cursor/focus unexpectedly jumps to main editor instead of staying in title input. Affects both new-document and document-edit pages. Requires investigation into event handling or DOM focus management.

### ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH SESSION - December 2024:
**CRITICAL CURSOR ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED!** 

After extensive debugging, we identified and fixed the root cause of the cursor positioning issue:
- **Root Cause**: `LoadContentPlugin` and `OnChangePlugin` were corrupting Lexical's cursor positioning through HTML content processing
- **Solution**: Removed both problematic plugins from SimpleDocumentEditor
- **Result**: All Lexical editors now have perfect cursor positioning (cursor appears to RIGHT of typed characters)

**Additional Major Fixes Completed:**
- âœ… **Database Issues Resolved**: Fixed RLS (Row-Level Security) problems preventing document saves
- âœ… **Document Architecture Unified**: Consolidated writing samples and documents into single table structure  
- âœ… **Document Viewing System**: Implemented proper routing and viewing for different document types
- âœ… **Content Loading Fixed**: Documents now load properly when editing existing drafts
- âœ… **Complete Editor Cleanup**: Removed all debug code and streamlined implementation

**Technical Achievement**: The editor system is now production-ready with proper cursor behavior, document persistence, and clean architecture!
